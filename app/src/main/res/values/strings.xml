        The ‘Aims’ of the NCC laid out in 1988 have stood the test of time and continue to meet the requirements expected
        of it in the current socio–economic scenario of the country. The NCC aims at developing character, comradeship,
        discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens.
        Further, it aims at creating a pool of organized, trained and motivated youth with leadership qualities in all walks
        of life, who will serve the Nation regardless of which career they choose. Needless to say,
        the NCC also provides an environment conducive to motivating young Indians to join the armed forces.

        The Cadet Corps Committee which was formed on 29 Sep 1946 with Pt HN Kunzru as chairman held six meetings in South Block,
        New Delhi.\t\t
        At the same time, Pt HN Kunzru formed sub-committees which were sent on study tours in all the main provinces of pre-independent
        India including provinces which are now located in Bangladesh and Pakistan.
        One sub-committee was also sent on tour to Great Britain and France from 15 Feb 1947 to 31 Mar 1947 to study the Youth
        and Cadet organisations in those countries.<br><br>


        The Cadet Corps Committee carried out exhaustive study of the problem of youth in India.
        Its sub-committees after their tour at home and abroad submitted their report to the Government of India in Mar 1947.
        Soon after the report was submitted, a far reaching political development began to impact the country, due to which the
        Cadet Corps Scheme had to be kept in abeyance. The religious strife which then was at its zenith, ultimately led to the
        partition of the country into India and Pakistan.<br><br>


       On the stroke of midnight of 14/15 Aug 1947, India achieved her independence.
       Immediately after independence, India was confronted with problems of formidable magnitude concerning not only
       repatriation of millions of displaced persons from Pakistan but also a full scale invasion of Kashmir by the Armed
       tribesmen supported by Pakistan. The armed forces had to rush to retrieve Kashmir at a time when they were already
       pre-occupied with the internal problem of maintaining law and order during the country's initial stage of consolidation.<br><br>


       The war in Kashmir and the consequent loss of a portion of Indian territory; the open support of Western Powers to Pakistan
       in the Security Council of the United Nations, made it more than evident to the Indian leaders that they not only had to strengthen
       the Armed Forces but also create sufficient strength of reserves, who could take up arms, when required.
       The gravity of time and event found expression in the Indian Legislature through anxious and pressing demand for military training of
       young men and women throughout the country.</p>

 At this juncture, Prime Minister PtJawaharLal Nehru at the behest of SardarBaldev Singh, the then Defence Minister and
 SardarVallabhbhai Patel, then Home Minister, took out the Kunzuru Committee Report for a serious studyfrom the shelves of
 the Defence Department. On 05 Dec 1947, after being approved by the Defence Committee the copy of the Cadet Corps Committee
 Report was sent to the Chief Secretaries and Chief Commissioners of all Provincial Govts (now called State Govts) for
 their comments. The consent of Provincial Govts were required because they were responsible for the administration of the
 educational institutions in their respective provinces and thus the success of the Cadet Corps scheme largely depended on
 their initiative. Replies received from the provinces in Jan 1948, show that they all agreed in principal with the Cadet
 Corps Scheme submitted by the Kunzuru Committee.</p>]]>

       <p>The NCC flag for various units of the NCC was first introduced in <b>1951</b>.</p>

<p>The flag was of same pattern, colour and size as was used by various regiments of the Army.</p>

<p>The only difference was that it had the NCC badge and unit designation placed in the centre.</p>

<p>Later on it was felt that the flag should be in keeping with the inter-service character of the Corps.</p>

<p>In 1954 the existing tri-colour flag was introduced.</p>

<p>The three colours in the flag depict the three services of the Corps, red for the Army, deep blue for the Navy and light blue for the Air Force.</p>

<p>The letters NCC and the NCC crest in gold in the middle of the flag encircled by a wreath of lotus, give the flag a colourful look and a distinct identity.</p>
